## What features would you need to find this useful?

### Different types of questions

Different things I want to track:

- what type of exercise? (options)
- how much sleep? (numeric freeform)
- happiness (done)
- what activities?

### Some way to actually make use of the data

- check out the daylio stats, that's a good start:
- activity count
- correlation between activities)
- chart of things over time
