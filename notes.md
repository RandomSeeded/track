## What features would you need to find this useful?

### Some way to actually make use of the data

- check out the daylio stats, that's a good start:
- activity count
- correlation between activities)
- chart of things over time

----

I'm thinking different types of metrics:

1. See individual entries (aka what did you answer today? What did you answer yesterday?) [done]
2. Aggregates
3. SQL :)

### Misc feature requests:

- reordering of questions
- ordering of answers matches order of questions

### Known bugs

- If you add a question and modify it (save or don't save) then add another question, the text from the previous question is lost

### Bugs you actually wrote down and then actually fixed (wow)

- You really need a 'are you sure' prompt for delete [done]

### Different types of questions

Different things I want to track:

- what type of exercise? (options) [done]
- how much sleep? (numeric freeform) [done]
- happiness (done) [done]
- what activities? [done]
