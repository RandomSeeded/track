What are the features that are required for you to be able to use?

1. Add reminder (every day, this hour)
2. Reminder -> send email
3. Click link from email which takes you to the questions (just one set of questions per user for now)
4. Ability to view your previous answers (prob needs a UI but can just be JSON for super MVP)

General strategy

POST route: write the event to a database (is this the best?)

Periodic job

Wakes up every minute
Checks the database for all events
Calculates the next event for each
Nah this is too much work to do every minute

--

The better algorithm:

- wake up every minute (or other period of time)
- check the queue of events to run and see if there's any events you need to run in the current minute
- if there are, run them, and add the next iteration of the event
- if there aren't, do nothing

Generating the event queue:
- Every time you start up, go through the database and check frequency and time of day
- Generate the next reminder. Just do once a day for now.
- [don't bother doing this hard algorithm]

THE SUPER FRICKIN SIMPLE ALGORITHM

- once an hour, wake up
- check if there are any events to be run that hour
- run them
- done
